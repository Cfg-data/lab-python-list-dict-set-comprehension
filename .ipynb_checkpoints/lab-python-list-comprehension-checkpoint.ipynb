    "In the previous exercise, you developed a program to manage customer orders and inventory. Now, let's take it a step further and incorporate comprehension into your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps below to complete the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review your code from the previous exercise and identify areas where you can apply comprehension to simplify and streamline your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Hint: Apply it to initialize inventory, updating the inventory and printing the updated inventory.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - For example, in initializing the inventory, we could have:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        def initialize_inventory(products):\n",
    "            inventory = {product: int(input(f\"Enter the quantity of {product}s available: \")) for product in products}\n",
    "            return inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Modify the function get_customer_orders so it prompts the user to enter the number of customer orders and gathers the product names using a loop and user input. Use comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add a new function to calculate the total price of the customer order. For each product in customer_orders, prompt the user to enter the price of that product. Use comprehension to calculate the total price. Note: assume that the user can only have 1 unit of each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modify the update_inventory function to remove the product from the inventory if its quantity becomes zero after fulfilling the customer orders. Use comprehension to filter out the products with a quantity of zero from the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Print the total price of the customer order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should produce output similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Enter the quantity of t-shirts available:  5\n",
